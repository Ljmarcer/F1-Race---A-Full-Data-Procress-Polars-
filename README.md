# **F1 Race -  A Full Data Procress Polars**
> Emulation a F1 Race, we try to create a dataset that finds the needs to compute the time of the laps of the driver.
> ##  Dataset Creation
We build a dataset with a timestamp , driver , scuderia and sector that it is currently on. 
> ##  Computation of Time Laps and Visualization of the results
After Dataset Creation we calculate the time of each sector and lap,

## Polars
Also this shows how versatile Polars framework is, [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) is a lightning fast DataFrame library/in-memory query engine. Its embarrassingly parallel execution, cache efficient algorithms and expressive API makes it perfect for efficient data wrangling, data pipelines, snappy APIs and so much more.
_Polars is about as fast as it gets._
